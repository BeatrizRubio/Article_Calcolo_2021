# Accurate computations with Wronskian matrices


In this repository, the bidiagonal decompositions (BDA) of Wronskian matrices of monomial basis and exponential basis are provided.

1. In [Weighted_Distribution](https://github.com/BeatriazRubio/Article_NLA2020/Weighted_Distribution/) the bidiagonal decompositions of the collocation matrices  different distributions are provided.
2. In [Weighted_rational_bases](https://github.com/BeatriazRubio/Article_NLA2020/Weighted_rational_bases/) the bidiagonal decomposition of the collocation matrices of a particular class of rational bases are provided.
3. In [Curve_fitting_HRA_general_rational_bases](https://github.com/BeatriazRubio/Article_NLA2020/Curve_fitting_HRA_general_rational_bases/) a Matlab application wi with the least square method for fitting the given set of data points from known curves by the curves obtained with a general class of rational bases is provided. 
4. In [Curve_fitting_HRA_general_particular_bases](https://github.com/BeatriazRubio/Article_NLA2020/Curve_fitting_HRA_particular_rational_bases/) a Matlab application wi with the least square method for fitting the given set of data points from known curves by the curves obtained with a general class of rational bases is provided.
